WAVE is a hub for exploring variety testing data for crops important to the Pacific Northwest. Currently, this includes wheat, with tools for barley, canola, lentils, dry peas, and chickpeas currently under construction. This is a multi-state effort to make current and historic variety testing data available to producers, researchers, agriculture professionals and anyone else interested in these data sets.

Our mission is to provide an online database open to all members of the public to explore current and historical variety testing data sets from the U.S. Pacific Northwest with the ability to filter, query, and download data. Analytical summaries of trials are or will be made available standalone and web apps for each crop.
